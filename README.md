# Todo_Nextjs
Learning Nextjs File Architecture and Website Development by building a basic Todo App 

### Running the Application
1. npm i
2. npm run dev
3. hosted on localhost:3000

### Steps of making a Nextjs project
1. Make a Folder and run command 'npm init -y'
2. Change the Scripts of the project in package.json

"scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  },

3. Run the command 'npm i -S next react react-dom'
4. Make a folder name 'pages', because Next while executing the project finds the pages folder first.
5. Make an index.js file and start coding.
